🔍 Dataset: I used a dataset of iris flowers, including measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with their corresponding species labels.

⚙️ Model Selection: I selected the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for its excellent performance in multi-class classification tasks like iris flower classification.

🔧 Achieved high accuracy on the test set and achieved good generalization performance.

🌟 Proud of the results achieved in accurately classifying iris flowers into setosa, versicolor, and virginica species.
